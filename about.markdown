I’m a passionate software engineer from Seville, in the south of Spain, with an M.Sc. in Computer Science from Universidad Politécnica de Madrid. My journey in tech began in 2007 in the Telematics Laboratory at the university, where I spent two years immersed in applied research, hands-on problem-solving, and developing foundational skills in computer science. This early experience solidified my drive for impactful engineering and laid a strong foundation for my career.

In 2009, I joined Cystelcom Sistemas, where I worked on projects for Vodafone Spain and Helvetia Seguros. These years were transformative, sharpening my technical skills and teaching me the importance of flexibility and collaboration with clients. The projects I contributed to were diverse, allowing me to deepen my expertise in delivering high-quality, customer-focused solutions within tight deadlines.

In June 2011, I embraced an international opportunity with Amadeus in the South of France. Initially, I joined their Payments team, where I worked with Java technology before moving to the core team focused on Aftersales Pricing Orchestration. Here, I was responsible for an ambitious project for Japan Airlines (JAL), developing an algorithm that enabled stakeholders to implement discount coupons—a challenging and fulfilling project that sharpened my C++ skills and honed my ability to build scalable solutions in complex environments.

My next big move was to Edinburgh in December 2017, where I joined NCR’s Data Platform Team. In this role, I worked with a range of technologies, including Java, Dropwizard, Hadoop, Hive, and Cassandra, diving deep into data-intensive projects and learning the nuances of data-driven engineering. This was an exciting chapter that expanded my knowledge in handling large data platforms and working in dynamic team settings.

In September 2018, I relocated to Berlin to work at Klarna. Within two years, I stepped into an Engineering Manager role, leading the onboarding team responsible for API integration with partners like Stripe, Adyen, and Mollie. This role has been tremendously rewarding, as I’ve had the opportunity to work alongside highly skilled teammates and learn new technologies like React, TypeScript, and JavaScript, along with core tech stacks including Java, Spring Boot, Kafka, AWS, DynamoDB, and PostgreSQL.

Since 2020, my experience as an Engineering Manager has reinforced my passion for system design, scalability, and high availability. While I have deep expertise in Java and Spring Boot, I am committed to learning new technologies that enhance my team's productivity and the systems we build. I believe in the power of continuous learning and strive to foster a collaborative, innovative environment wherever I go.
