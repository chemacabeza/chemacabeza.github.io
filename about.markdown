I’m a software engineer originally from the south of Spain, with an M.Sc. in Computer Science from Universidad Politécnica de Madrid. My career began in Madrid in 2007, where I honed my skills and developed a solid foundation in software development. In 2011, I seized an exciting opportunity with Amadeus in the South of France, joining their Payments team, where I specialized in Java technology. Later, I moved to the company’s core, focusing on Aftersales Pricing Orchestration, where I worked with C++ to manage complex pricing and re-pricing systems, gaining valuable experience in high-impact software engineering.

My journey then led me to Edinburgh in 2017, where I joined NCR’s Data Platform Team. This position allowed me to delve deeply into data-driven technologies, including Java, Dropwizard, Hadoop, Hive, and Cassandra. Working with NCR gave me insight into big data environments and further broadened my technical expertise, preparing me for the complexities of building and managing large-scale systems. I thrived in this role, absorbing the nuances of handling vast data sets and optimizing performance for data-driven applications.

In September 2018, I transitioned to Klarna in Berlin, marking a pivotal moment in my career. My work in the onboarding team focused on API integration, helping distribution partners like Stripe, Adyen, and Mollie connect merchants to the Klarna ecosystem. By September 2020, I stepped into an Engineering Manager role within the onboarding team, where I managed a highly skilled team and expanded my skill set with React, JavaScript, TypeScript, AWS, Kafka, DynamoDB, and PostgreSQL. Leading a team here has been a rewarding experience, allowing me to refine both my technical and managerial skills.

As an Engineering Manager, I am dedicated to designing scalable and high-availability systems. My core expertise lies in Java and Spring Boot, but I continuously explore new technologies to ensure my teams stay at the forefront of innovation. I’m passionate about system design and performance optimization, striving to build solutions that are robust, reliable, and efficient. This drive to create well-engineered systems has been central to my work, from early development to overseeing complex engineering projects.

A firm believer in lifelong learning, I am always eager to deepen my knowledge and adapt to emerging technologies. Whether it’s mastering a new framework, tackling a challenging project, or mentoring others, I find great satisfaction in continuous improvement. I approach each challenge as an opportunity to grow, constantly seeking ways to elevate my skills and contribute to impactful, high-performing engineering solutions.
