# Chapter 15: Functions


<hr style="width:100%;text-align:center;margin-left:0;margin-bottom:10px;">

Now that we have learnt the basic blocks of Bash we are going to add another layer of abstraction that are… the functions.

In Bash scripting, functions serve as essential building blocks that allow for the modularization and organization of code. A function in Bash is a self-contained block of code that performs a specific task, and it can be invoked or called from anywhere within the script. This modular approach not only enhances code readability but also promotes code reuse, making scripts more efficient and maintainable.

To declare a function in Bash, the “`function`” keyword or a shorthand syntax with parentheses is used, followed by the function name and the curly braces that encapsulate the function body. Functions may or may not receive arguments, allowing for flexibility in handling input parameters. Additionally, they can return values to the calling code, contributing to the versatility of Bash scripts.

Functions in Bash enable the creation of structured and organized scripts by encapsulating specific functionalities. As we go deeper into Bash scripting, we will explore the syntax, parameters, return values, and best practices for utilizing functions. Understanding how to leverage functions enhances the efficiency and readability of Bash scripts, contributing to the development of robust and maintainable automation solutions.

## Declaration

In Bash scripting, declaring a function involves specifying the function's name, defining its behavior or code block, and optionally providing parameters that the function can accept. The syntax for declaring a function is straightforward and can be done using either the “`function`” keyword or a concise shorthand notation.
