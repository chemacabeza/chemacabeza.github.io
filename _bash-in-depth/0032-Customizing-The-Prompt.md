# Chapter 32: Customizing The Prompt


<hr style="width:100%;text-align:center;margin-left:0;margin-bottom:10px">

## Introduction

The **prompt** in Bash is the text displayed in your terminal, signaling that the shell is ready to receive and execute commands. It is the interface between you and the Bash shell, making it a fundamental part of the user experience.

By default, the prompt in Bash provides useful information such as the current user, hostname, and working directory. However, it is highly customizable, allowing you to tailor it to your workflow, preferences, or environment. A well-designed prompt can enhance productivity by displaying relevant details, such as the current Git branch, exit status of the last command, or even system resource usage.

The main components of the prompt in Bash are:

1. **Primary Prompt** (`PS1`): This is the most commonly seen prompt, used for interactive shells to signal that Bash is ready for a command. For instance:

```bash
user@hostname:~$
```

2. **Secondary Prompt** (`PS2`): This prompt appears when more input is needed, such as when a command spans multiple lines. The default is "`>`".

3. **Error Prompt** (`PS3`): Used in the "`select`" loop when Bash requires input for choices.

4. **Debug Prompt** (`PS4`): Used when the "`-x`" debugging option is enabled, with the default value being "`+`".

## Why Customize the Prompt?

Customizing the prompt is not just about aesthetics; it can improve your workflow by:
* Displaying critical system information at a glance.
* Indicating the state of the shell or current command.
* Reducing errors by showing contextual information, like the working directory or version control status.

**Example of a Custom Prompt**

Hereâ€™s an example of a more informative prompt:

```bash
PS1="\u@\h:\w ($(git branch 2>/dev/null | grep '*' | sed "s/* //")) \$ "
```

This prompt includes:
* "`\u`": Current username.
* "`\h`": Hostname of the system.
* "`\w`": Current working directory.
* Git branch name if inside a Git repository.

The result might look like this:

<pre style="background-color:#2d2d37">
<span style="color:white;">user</span><span style="color:pink;">@hostname</span><span style="color:red;">:~/projects/myapp</span> <span style="color:white;">(main)</span> <span style="color:white;">$</span>
</pre>
